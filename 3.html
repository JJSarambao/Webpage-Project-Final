<h3>Start: Games</h3>
<h4> 1. Terraria</h4>
    <img id="Terraria" src="Terrariaaa.jpg" alt="WTF" height="215" width="460">
    <p>a 2D action-adventure sandbox video game developed by Re-Logic. The game was initially released for Microsoft Windows in May 2011, and has since been released for various other platforms and devices. Gameplay of Terraria features exploration, crafting, building, and combat with a variety of creatures in a procedurally generated 2D world. Terraria received generally positive critical reception upon release, with direct comparisons to Minecraft and praise given to its sandbox elements. By February 2017, the game had sold over 20 million copies across every platform.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraria">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></p>
<h4> 2. Kerbal Space Program</h4>
    <img id="KSP" src="KSP.jpg" alt="Server Crash. Try again Later" height="300" width="890">
    <p> A space flight simulation video game developed and published by Squad for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and will be made available on Wii U at a later date. In the game, players direct a nascent space program, staffed and crewed by humanoid aliens known as "Kerbals". The game features a very realistic orbital physics engine, allowing for various real-life orbital maneuvers such as Hohmann transfer orbits and Bi-elliptic transfer orbits.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerbal_Space_Program">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup></p>
<h4> 3. Portal 2</h4>
<img id="portal" src="Portal%202%20%5Bwww.imagesplitter.net%5D.jpeg" alt="Editor Fault" height="225" width="770">
<p>A series of first-person puzzle-platform video games developed by Valve Corporation. Set in the Half-Life universe, the two games in the series, Portal (2007) and Portal 2 (2011), center on a woman, Chell, forced to undergo a series of tests within the Aperture Science Enrichment Center by a malicious artificial intelligence computer, GLaDOS, that controls the facility. Each test involves using the "Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device" - the "portal gun" - that creates a human-sized wormhole-like connection between nearly any two flat surfaces. The player-character or objects in the game world may move through portals, their momentum conserved. This allows complex "flinging" maneuvers to be used to cross wide gaps or perform other feats to reach the exit for each test chamber. A number of other mechanics, such as lasers, light bridges, tractor funnels, and turrets, exist to aid or hinder the player's goal to reach the exit.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(series)">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup></p>
