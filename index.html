<h1> First Person Shooter </h1>
<p> First-person shooter (FPS) is a video game genre which is centered on gun and projectile weapon-based combat through a first-person perspective; that is, the player experiences the action through the eyes of the protagonist. </p>
<p>The first-person shooter shares common traits with other shooter games, which in turn fall under the heading action game. From the genre's inception, advanced 3;D or pseudo-3;D graphics have challenged hardware development, and multiplayer gaming has been integral.</p>
<br>
<p>It&#39;s not only FPS. there are other Genres of a Game i Like, Adventure, Simulation, Science &#40;As Always...&#41;, etc. I'll not explain that anymore. </p>
